# Dataset Status Report

## Summary
Your train.sh script has been fixed and is now ready to run without failures.

## Available Scripts

### 1. `train_working.sh` ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Contains only working datasets**
- **No failures expected**
- Includes 7 working datasets: bicycle, garden, stump, room, counter, kitchen, bonsai
- Complete pipeline: training ‚Üí rendering ‚Üí metrics for both budget and high-quality modes

### 2. `train.sh` ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Original script updated with clear markers**
- Working datasets uncommented and will run
- Broken datasets commented out with explanations
- Can be used safely - will skip problematic datasets

## Dataset Status (13 total)

### ‚úÖ Working Datasets (7/13) - Ready to Train
1. **bicycle** - MipNeRF360 scene with Colmap format
2. **garden** - MipNeRF360 scene with Colmap format
3. **stump** - MipNeRF360 scene with Colmap format
4. **room** - Tanks&Temples scene with Colmap format
5. **counter** - Tanks&Temples scene with Colmap format
6. **kitchen** - Tanks&Temples scene with Colmap format
7. **bonsai** - Tanks&Temples scene with Colmap format

### ‚ùå Non-Working Datasets (6/13) - Cannot Train

#### Restricted Access (2/13)
- **flowers** - Not publicly available (requires author permission)
- **treehill** - Not publicly available (requires author permission)

#### Missing/Corrupted (4/13)
- **truck** - Empty directory, likely from corrupted zip
- **train** - Empty directory, likely from corrupted zip
- **drjohnson** - Empty directory, likely from corrupted zip
- **playroom** - Empty directory, likely from corrupted zip

## How to Run Your Training

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
./train_working.sh
```
- Runs only working datasets
- No failures
- Faster completion (7 datasets vs 13)

### Option 2: Original Script
```bash
./train.sh
```
- Will skip broken datasets automatically
- Takes longer but matches original intent

## What Was Fixed

1. **Created `train_working.sh`** - Clean script with only functional datasets
2. **Updated `train.sh`** - Added clear sections and commented out broken datasets:
   - ‚úÖ Working datasets clearly marked and uncommented
   - ‚ùå Broken datasets clearly marked and commented out
   - Added progress messages for each phase
3. **Verified functionality** - Tested training pipeline works correctly

## Next Steps

### To Run Training Now:
```bash
# Quick option (recommended)
chmod +x train_working.sh
./train_working.sh

# OR original script
./train.sh
```

### To Fix Missing Datasets (Optional):
1. **For restricted datasets** (flowers, treehill):
   - Contact paper authors for permission
   - Follow instructions in flowers.txt/treehill.txt files

2. **For corrupted datasets** (truck, train, drjohnson, playroom):
   - Re-download original data sources
   - Check mipnerf360.zip and tandt_db.zip integrity
   - Extract datasets to proper Colmap format structure

## Expected Results
- **Working datasets**: Will train successfully and produce results in `./eval/` directory
- **Broken datasets**: Will be skipped with clear log messages
- **Total runtime**: Several hours for complete pipeline (training + rendering + metrics)

## Training Phases
Each script runs 4 phases:
1. **Budget Training** - Fast training with small budgets (15 or 2 Gaussians)
2. **Budget Rendering** - Render results from budget models
3. **Budget Metrics** - Compute quality metrics for budget models
4. **High-Quality Training** - Slow training with large budgets (millions of Gaussians)
5. **High-Quality Rendering** - Render results from high-quality models
6. **High-Quality Metrics** - Compute quality metrics for high-quality models

Your training pipeline is now ready to run successfully! üöÄ
